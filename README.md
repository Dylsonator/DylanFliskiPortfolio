# My Projects
## Unity
### Dijkstra's algorithm StarMap Navigation (C#)
[GitHubRepo(Build Available)](https://github.com/Dylsonator/ct4101-a2-star-map-navigation-simulation-DylanFliski-main)
For an Assignment I was tasked with implementing a star-map navigation style simulation within the Unity Game Engine, utilizing my own pathfinding and movement methods. This simulation employed the mathematical techniques I developed over the course of the module. I did not make use of Unity's built-in navigation or lerp systems. (Graded 64 (B)) <br />

[GitHubRepo(Build Unavailable)](https://github.com/Dylsonator/ct5108-assignment-1-lobby-DylanFliski-main)<br />
For an assignment was to provide practical experience in creating multiplayer game prototypes using C++ in Unreal Engine 5. I was tasked with creating a Main Menu system that led into a multiplayer game, complete with UI animations and sound effects. The gameplay elements did not need to be feature-complete and could contain only a small demo scene, but the menu loop and UI elements needed to be fully feature-complete. This was to be created using C++, utilizing Unreal Engine 5.
