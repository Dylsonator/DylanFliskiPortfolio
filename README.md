# My Projects
## Unity
### Dijkstra's algorithm StarMap Navigation (C#)
[GitHubRepo(Build Available)](https://github.com/Dylsonator/ct4101-a2-star-map-navigation-simulation-DylanFliski-main)<br />

For an Assignment I was tasked with implementing a star-map navigation style simulation within the Unity Game Engine, utilizing my own pathfinding and movement methods. This simulation employed the mathematical techniques I developed over the course of the module. I did not make use of Unity's built-in navigation or lerp systems. (Graded 64 (2:1)) <br />

## Unreal Engine
### 3D Boids (C++)
[GitHubRepo(Build Unvailable)](https://github.com/Dylsonator/ct5108-assignment-2-boids-DylanFliski)<br />
[Demonstration Video](https://youtu.be/hzgmNK61kY0) <br />
For an Assignment i was tasked with creating a 3D Boid Simulation using basic steering and flocking behavior AI. This simulation was to be created using the C++ programming language, utilizing Unreal Engine 5. Alongside my submission, I was required to submit a code report using a provided template. (Awaiting Grade)

### Main Menu/MultiPlayer (Blueprints)
[GitHubRepo(Build Unavailable)](https://github.com/Dylsonator/ct5108-assignment-1-lobby-DylanFliski-main)<br />
[Demonstration Video](https://youtu.be/sBhJQO_rXos)<br />
For an assignment I was tasked with creating creating multiplayer game prototypes using C++ in Unreal Engine 5. I was tasked with creating a Main Menu system that led into a multiplayer game, complete with UI animations and sound effects. The gameplay elements did not need to be feature-complete and could contain only a small demo scene, but the menu loop and UI elements needed to be fully feature-complete. This was to be created using C++, utilizing Unreal Engine 5.(Graded 72 (First)) <br />

### Character Creator (Blueprints)
[GitHubRepo(Build Unavailable)](https://github.com/Dylsonator/ct4102-character-creator-DylanFliski-main)<br />
[Demonstration Video](https://youtu.be/kfbytZMiNyw)<br />
For an assignment I was tasked with building a "Character Creator" mechanic, commonly found in racing games, MMOs, and RPGs. I was not required to produce art or art assets and was encouraged to use publicly available packs in my submission, with appropriate academic referencing. This assessment aimed to explore my understanding of Unreal Engine 5 and the C++ programming language. (Graded 63 (2:1)) <br />
